# Code Description
This repository contains a script that processes XML annotations and generates label files for object detection tasks. The script assumes that each image in the dataset has only one annotated object.

# Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the script:

# ast
os.path
xml.dom.minidom
Make sure to install these dependencies before running the script.

# Getting Started
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Navigate to the repository directory:
bash
Copy code
cd your-repository
Prepare the XML Annotations

Create an XML file named annotations.xml containing the annotations for your dataset.
Ensure that the XML file follows the required format, including image width, height, object points, and bounding box coordinates.
Run the Script

Execute the following command to run the script:

bash
Copy code
python process_annotations.py
Output

The script will create a directory named out if it doesn't already exist.
Inside the out directory, a text file will be generated for each annotated image, representing the label file for object detection.
The label files will be named after the corresponding image file, with the extension .txt.
Notes
The script assumes that each image has only one annotated object. If your dataset contains multiple objects per image, you may need to modify the script accordingly.
Ensure that the image files referenced in the XML annotations are located in the same directory as the script or provide the appropriate file paths.

Certainly! Here's an example README file for your code on GitHub:

# Pose Detection using YOLOv8

This repository contains code for pose detection using YOLOv8, implemented using the Ultralytics library. The code is designed to train a pose detection model and perform inference on images.

## Pretrained Model

A pretrained model, `yolov8n-pose.pt`, is provided in this repository. It is recommended to use this pretrained model for training.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training

1. Prepare the Data

   - Create a configuration file `config.yaml` specifying the paths to the train and validation image directories.
   - Ensure that the image files are organized in the following directory structure:

     ```
     ├── images
     │   ├── train
     │   └── val
     └── ...
     ```

2. Start Training

   - Run the following command to start the training process:

     ```bash
     python train.py --data config.yaml --epochs 1 --imgsz 640
     ```

   - Adjust the `--epochs` and `--imgsz` parameters as desired.

### Inference

1. Perform Pose Detection on Images

   - Update the `model_path` variable in `inference.py` to point to the path of the trained model.

   - Run the following command to perform pose detection on an image:

     ```bash
     python inference.py --image_path samples/wolf.jpg
     ```

   - The script will display the image with keypoints annotated.

## Keypoints

The keypoints used in this pose detection model are represented as a list of [x, y, confidence] values. The `kpt_shape` parameter in the configuration file specifies the shape of the keypoints array.

The `flip_idx` parameter in the configuration file defines the indices of keypoints that should be flipped during augmentation or post-processing.

## Classes

The model recognizes the following classes:

- 0: quadruped nose
